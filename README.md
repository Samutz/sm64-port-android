*****Note that termux only makes a build based off the device it's made with. So a 32 bit device will only make a build compatible with 32 bit. The same with a 64 bit device. It will only make a 64 bit compatible build*****

1. Get termux from f-droid https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/

2. Install termux and run the commands:
   pkg update and then pkg upgrade

You will get the following message multiple times:
